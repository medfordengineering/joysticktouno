Forget the car keys. Leave me a planet.

I don't need a ride. I need a planet.

Ed,

Okay, ten images done. It is quite fortunate that I
have been home sick with the flu all week or none of
this would have gotten done! And I might add that this
has been a lot of fun.

Below are some more that I thought of last night mostly
on the carfree theme. Generally, I am trying to appeal
to the widest audience, religious, right wing, left
wing, etc. I admit the last one is a bit much.

Look forward to getting together.

Sam

Keep flying. Darwin has a plan.

85% of adults don't own cars. Join the crowd.

You need a car. We need a planet.

Drive your kids to the end of the earth.

Keep driving like there's no tomorrow.

Cars rock. Waves roll.

WWJD? Take the bus.

Drive now. Swim later.

Keep driving. Someone else will solve the problem.

Teach your kids carpentry. Noah might need a hand.

Drive to the zoo and see all the animals your killing.
