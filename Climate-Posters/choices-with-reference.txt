Hi Sam,

I assume that your numbers are "pounds of CO2" is that right?

I'm checking your numbers with David MacKay's book "Sustainable Energy without the Hot Air".

Here's the numbers I find:
For 10 incandescent lights - 5 kWh (energy per day per home)
For 10 low-energy lights - 0.5 kWh (energy per day per home)

To convert kWh to pounds of CO2, 
http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=74&t=11

Let's say it's 2 lbs of CO2 per kWh. A savings of 4.5 kWh per day x 2 lbs of CO2 per kWh = 9 lbs CO2 per day? Or 3,285 lbs per year?

Have I done this correctly? I really don't know if these numbers make any sense, do you?

Lenni
