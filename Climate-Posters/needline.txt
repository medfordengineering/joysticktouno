Hello,

If you have a minute could you point me to some
statements that relate cars to climate change? I am
looking for something along the lines of, "Avaiation is
the fastest growing cause of climate change." except
with respect to cars or the car industry.

I am working on some climate change posters and I need
a tag line for them. Recently I created a dozen
anti-aviation climate change posters with different
provocative slogans and the same tag line quoted above.
I am now doing the same with a focus on cars.

I would appreciate any help!

Thanks,
Sam
